        The book <u><strong>The Great Gatsby</strong></u> by <u><strong>F. Scott Fitzgerald</strong></u> is a
        *intriguing* tale that explores the themes of *love* and *wealth* in the *Roaring Twenties*.
        The story follows the *mysterious* millionaire Jay Gatsby and his obsession with the *beautiful* Daisy Buchanan.
        It portrays the *disillusionment* of the American Dream and its consequences. The *lush* descriptions and
        *complex* characters make it a *timeless* classic.
